### ABOUT US

Dott is the Portugal's largest marketplace! We were born from a Joint Venture between Sonae and CTT, and we want to change the way people buy and sell online, and to help digitize Portuguese brands by opening their business to the world.

We have 17 product categories, and brands loved throughout the country, from the smallest to the bigger ones. We believe that there are excellent and uniquely positioned brands in Portugal!

Our goals for the next two years are to reach over five million products, from five thousand partners, as well as become Portugalâ€™s reference marketplace.

### OUR CULTURE

At Dott we go above and beyond to ensure that everyone is happy at work, and that the experience is focussed on giving every business the opportunity to achieve greater things through e-commerce. This is our spirit: that everyone at Dott continuously achieves more, and for this, we believe in the power of having a strong community.

At Dott we believe that we can help Portuguese companies achieve more through online sales. This includes smaller companies composed of people who have a vision or project, and want to make it grow, just like us. This is the purpose that guides us and where we stand together.

Whoever joins Dott believes in this vision, but also knows that we focus on the people who work in making this happen. They also know that they can grow in a place that makes everyone feel like they belong to a common project.
